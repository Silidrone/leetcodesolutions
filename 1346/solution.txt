# Intuition
We want to find if there exists an element such that one is double the other.  
Instead of checking every pair (which is $$O(n^2)$$), we can track elements weâ€™ve seen and check for each if its double or half already appeared.

# Approach
- Traverse the array once.
- For each element `e`, check if it exists in the `seen` set (meaning we previously inserted `2 * e` or `e / 2`).
- Insert `e * 2` and, if `e` is even, insert `e / 2` into the set.
- If a match is found during traversal, return true.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$  
- Space complexity: $$O(n)$$
