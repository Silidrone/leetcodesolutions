Intuition  
To find the k-th largest element, we can maintain a min-heap of size k. The smallest element in this heap will always be the k-th largest among the elements seen so far.

Approach  
Insert the first k elements into a min-heap. Then for each remaining element, if it's larger than the heap's top, replace the top with it. After processing all elements, the top of the heap is the k-th largest.

Complexity  
Time complexity: $$O(n \log k)$$  
Space complexity: $$O(k)$$
