Intuition  
We want to find the k most frequent elements in the array. Using a frequency map and a min-heap allows us to efficiently track the top k elements based on their frequency.

Approach  
Count the frequency of each number using a hash map. Then use a min-heap (priority queue) of size k to keep track of the k most frequent elements. If a new element has a higher frequency than the heap's top, replace it. At the end, extract elements from the heap to get the result.

Complexity  
Time complexity: $$O(n \log k)$$  
Space complexity: $$O(n + k)$$
