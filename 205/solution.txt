Intuition  
Two strings are isomorphic if characters in one string can be replaced to get the other, with a one-to-one and consistent mapping. We need to make sure both directions of mapping are valid.

Approach  
Use two hash maps: one to track mapping from s to t and another from t to s. For each character pair, check if the existing mapping (if any) is consistent. If any mismatch is found, return false. If we finish checking all characters without conflict, return true.

Complexity  
Time complexity: $$O(n)$$  
Space complexity: $$O(1)$$
