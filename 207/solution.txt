Intuition  
To determine if all courses can be finished, we need to check for cycles in the directed course dependency graph. A cycle means some course depends on itself through a chain, making completion impossible.

Approach  
Build an adjacency list from prerequisites. Use DFS to detect cycles. Track the current path with a set (path), if we revisit a node already in the current path, a cycle exists. Mark nodes as visited after processing them to avoid redundant checks.

Complexity  
Time complexity: $$O(n + e)$$ where \( n \) is the number of courses, and \( e \) is the number of prerequisites  
Space complexity: $$O(n + e)$$ for adjacency list, visited set, and path set
