Intuition  
We need to place N queens on an N x N board so that no two queens attack each other. This means no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. We use backtracking to try placing a queen in each row.

Approach  
Use 3 arrays to track which columns and diagonals are under attack. For each row, try placing a queen in a column thatâ€™s not attacked. Mark the attack vectors, recurse, then backtrack.

Complexity  
Time complexity: $$O(n!)$$  
Each row tries n positions, next row n - 1, and so on.  
Space complexity: $$O(n^2)$$ for storing the board and solutions.
