Intuition  
We want the longest subarray with equal number of 0s and 1s. By treating 0 as -1, the problem reduces to finding the longest subarray with a sum of 0.

Approach  
Convert 0s to -1s and compute a running prefix sum. Use a hash map to record the first index where each prefix sum occurs. If the same sum appears again, it means the subarray between those indices has a net sum of 0, i.e., equal 0s and 1s. Track the maximum such length.

Complexity  
Time complexity: $$O(n)$$  
Space complexity: $$O(n)$$
