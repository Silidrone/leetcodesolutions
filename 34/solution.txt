Intuition
First binary search keeps doing l = m + 1 in case of equality, which ends up shrinking toward the end of the array.

I also keep a flag here, if the target hasn't been found at all in the first binary search, we return [-1, -1] immediately.

Second binary search keeps doing r = m in case of equality, which ends up shrinking toward the beginning of the array.

Complexity
Time complexity: O(logn)
Space complexity: O(1)
