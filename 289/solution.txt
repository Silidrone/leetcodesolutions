# Intuition
This is a simulation problem. For each cell, we count how many of its 8 neighbors are live, then apply the given rules to determine the cell’s next state. To avoid modifying cells before they’re used for neighbor calculations, we work with a copy of the board.

# Approach
- Create a copy of the board to read from, while writing changes to the original board.
- For each cell, check the 8 neighboring cells.
- Count live neighbors.
- Apply the Game of Life rules to determine the cell’s next state.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(m \cdot n)$$  
- Space complexity: $$O(m \cdot n)$$, due to using a full copy of the board.
