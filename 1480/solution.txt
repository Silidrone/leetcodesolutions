Intuition
A running sum means each element at index i is the sum of all elements before it including itself. We can compute this incrementally in one pass.

Approach
We iterate from the second element onwards and for each position, add the previous running sum to the current number. Store results in a new array.

Complexity
Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(n)
