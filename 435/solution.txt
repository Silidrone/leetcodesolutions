Intuition  
To minimize the number of intervals to remove so that the rest are non-overlapping, we want to keep as many non-overlapping intervals as possible â€” a classic greedy interval scheduling problem.

Approach  
Sort the intervals by their end time. Then iterate through them, always keeping the interval that ends earliest (to allow more room for future intervals). Count any interval that overlaps with the previously selected one and mark it for removal.

Complexity  
Time complexity: $$O(n \log n)$$ due to sorting  
Space complexity: $$O(1)$$
