Intuition  
To find the maximum water container, we need two lines that enclose the most area. Since the area is determined by the shorter height and the distance between lines, a two-pointer approach helps explore the optimal combination efficiently.

Approach  
Use two pointers at the ends of the array. Calculate the area formed by the two heights. Move the pointer pointing to the shorter line inward to potentially find a taller line and increase area. Continue until the pointers meet.

Complexity  
Time complexity: $$O(n)$$  
Space complexity: $$O(1)$$
