Intuition  
To reverse a linked list, we can use a stack to store all the nodes as we traverse the list. Since stacks are LIFO, popping nodes and relinking them gives us the reversed list.

Approach  
Traverse the list and push each node onto a stack. Then pop nodes one by one and link them in reverse order. Finally, set the original head's `next` pointer to null to terminate the new list.

Complexity  
Time complexity: $$O(n)$$  
Space complexity: $$O(n)$$ due to the stack
