Intuition
To clone an undirected graph, we must deep-copy each node and all of its neighbors. Since the graph may contain cycles, we need to track visited nodes to avoid infinite recursion and reuse already cloned nodes.

Approach
Use DFS to traverse the graph. Create a new node for each unvisited node, store it in a visited list using its value as an index, and recursively clone its neighbors. If a node has already been cloned (i.e., exists in `visited`), reuse it instead of creating a new one.

Complexity
Time complexity: $$O(n)$$ — each node is visited once  
Space complexity: $$O(n)$$ — for the visited list and recursion stack
