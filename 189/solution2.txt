Intuition  
To rotate an array to the right by k steps, we can use the reverse approach to do it in-place without extra space. Reversing parts of the array repositions elements efficiently.

Approach  
First, reverse the entire array. Then, reverse the first k elements to restore their order, followed by reversing the rest. This simulates rotating the array to the right by k steps.

Complexity  
Time complexity: $$O(n)$$  
Space complexity: $$O(1)$$
