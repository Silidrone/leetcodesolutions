Intuition  
To insert a new interval into a sorted list of non-overlapping intervals and maintain the merged form, we can insert the new interval at the correct position and then merge as usual.

Approach  
First, find the correct position to insert the new interval based on its start time. Shift elements to make space and insert it. Then call the merge function to combine any overlapping intervals.

Complexity  
Time complexity: $$O(n \log n)$$ (due to sorting in merge), but insertion is $$O(n)$$  
Space complexity: $$O(n)$$ for the result
