Intuition  
To get a bottom-up level order traversal, we can perform a regular BFS (top-down), then simply reverse the result at the end.

Approach  
Use a queue with BFS to gather nodes level by level. Store each levelâ€™s values in a vector. After traversal, reverse the result vector so the bottom-most level comes first.

Complexity  
Time complexity: $$O(n)$$, all nodes are visited once  
Space complexity: $$O(n)$$, for the queue and result vector
