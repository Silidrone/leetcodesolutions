Intuition
We need to compute the product of all elements except the current one, without using division. This hints at prefix and suffix product techniques.

Approach
First, compute the left-to-right prefix products for each index. Then, traverse from right to left, multiplying each entry with the running product of elements to the right.

Complexity
Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(n)
