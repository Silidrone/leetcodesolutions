Intuition  
To return the level-order traversal of a binary tree, we need to visit nodes level by level from top to bottom, left to right â€” this is naturally done using BFS.

Approach  
Use a queue to perform BFS. Track the current level alongside each node in the queue. For each node, if its level hasn't been added to the result vector yet, add a new subvector. Then enqueue its children with level + 1.

Complexity  
Time complexity: $$O(n)$$, we visit each node once  
Space complexity: $$O(n)$$, for the queue and the result storage
