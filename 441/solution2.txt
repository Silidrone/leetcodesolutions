# Intuition
We use the formula for the sum of the first `k` natural numbers:
$$\frac{k(k + 1)}{2} \leq n$$  
This leads to solving the quadratic inequality:
$$k^2 + k - 2n \leq 0$$  
Solving for `k` using the quadratic formula:
$$k = \left\lfloor \frac{-1 + \sqrt{1 + 8n}}{2} \right\rfloor$$

# Approach
- Plug `n` into the closed-form formula derived above.
- Return the floored result to get the largest complete row that can be formed.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(\log n)$$ due to std::sqrt
- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$
