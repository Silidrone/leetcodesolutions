Intuition  
We want to collect all root-to-leaf paths in a binary tree. This is a natural use case for a depth-first traversal (preorder), where we build the path string as we descend.

Approach  
Use recursion to traverse the tree. For each node, append its value to the current path. If itâ€™s a leaf node, store the path. Otherwise, continue the traversal by passing the updated path to left and right children.

Complexity  
Time complexity: $$O(n)$$  
Space complexity: $$O(h)$$ (due to recursion stack), where \( n \) is the number of nodes and \( h \) is the tree height
