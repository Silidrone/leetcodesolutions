Intuition  
To efficiently compute the sum of any subarray multiple times, we can preprocess the input using prefix sums. This allows us to answer each query in constant time.

Approach  
In the constructor, build a prefix sum array where each entry at index i stores the sum of elements from 0 to i. To answer a query for the sum from index left to right, subtract the prefix sum at left-1 from the prefix sum at right.

Complexity  
Time complexity (constructor): $$O(n)$$  
Time complexity (sumRange): $$O(1)$$  
Space complexity: $$O(n)$$
