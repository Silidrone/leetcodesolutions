Intuition
The problem involves finding the maximum distance between two indices i and j (with i <= j) such that nums1[i] <= nums2[j]. Since nums1 and nums2 are both non-increasing arrays, we can take advantage of their structure to avoid a brute-force O(n^2) solution.

The key insight is that for each element in nums1, we can binary search in nums2 (starting from the same index i) to find the furthest index j such that the inequality still holds. This gives us the largest possible j - i for each i efficiently.

Complexity
Time complexity: O(nlogn)
Space complexity: O(1)
