Intuition  
To check if an integer is a palindrome, we can reverse its digits and compare it with the original. Negative numbers are automatically not palindromes due to the minus sign.

Approach  
If the number is negative, return false. Otherwise, reverse the number by extracting digits and rebuilding it. Then compare the reversed number to the original input.

Complexity  
Time complexity: $$O(\log_{10} x)$$  
Space complexity: $$O(1)$$
