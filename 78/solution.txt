Intuition  
To generate all subsets of a list, we can use recursion. At each index, we either include the current number or skip it. This leads to all possible combinations of elements.

Approach  
Start from the first index. For each recursive call, build combinations that include the current element. Then combine it with all previously generated subsets. Push the single-element subset now, and empty set at the end.

Complexity  
Time complexity: $$O(2^n \cdot n)$$, there are \( 2^n \) subsets, and each takes up to \( O(n) \) to copy  
Space complexity: $$O(2^n \cdot n)$$ for storing all subsets
