Intuition  
A number is happy if repeatedly replacing it with the sum of the squares of its digits eventually leads to 1. If we fall into a cycle that doesnâ€™t include 1, the number is not happy.

Approach  
Use a set to store previously seen numbers to detect cycles. For each number, compute the sum of the squares of its digits. If the result is 1, return true. If we encounter a number we've seen before, return false (cycle detected).

Complexity  
Time complexity: $$O(\log n)$$ per iteration, total iterations are bounded due to the cycle  
Space complexity: $$O(\log n)$$ due to storing intermediate results in a set
