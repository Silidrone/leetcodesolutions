My solutions to various leetcode challenges. The solutions are given in the
format that the leetcode understands (I mean a solution class and whatnot).
You will need to do a bit of work to be able to run it outside of leetcode.
But you can easily find the challenges by their codes (directory name) on
leetcode.
