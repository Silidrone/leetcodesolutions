Intuition  
In a rotated sorted array with no duplicates, the minimum element is the pivot point. Binary search can help us efficiently locate it by comparing mid with the right end.

Approach  
Use binary search. If nums[mid] < nums[r], the minimum lies in the left half (including mid). Otherwise, it's in the right half (excluding mid). Repeat until l == r, which will be the index of the minimum.

Complexity  
Time complexity: $$O(\log n)$$  
Space complexity: $$O(1)$$
