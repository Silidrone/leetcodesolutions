Intuition  
To find the minimum element in a rotated sorted array, we can locate the pivot point: the point where the order breaks. The minimum is either at the start or at the pivot index.

Approach  
Use modified binary search to find the pivot, which is the index where the array drops (nums[i] > nums[i+1]). If no pivot is found, the array is not rotated and the first element is the minimum. Otherwise, return the smaller of nums[0] and nums[pivot].

Complexity  
Time complexity: $$O(\log n)$$  
Space complexity: $$O(\log n)$$ due to recursion (can be $$O(1)$$ if converted to iterative)
