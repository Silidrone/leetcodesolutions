Intuition
Given any k, determining how fast (in terms of hours) Koko can eat all the piles is O(n) time. We just loop through the piles and if pile == k, then we count 1, otherwise we count ceil(pile_bananas/k). Then, all we need to do is apply binary search to find the minimum k to finish all piles within h hours. We already have the function to evaluate how much hours k yields.

Complexity
Given:

n: number of piles
b: maximum bananas in any pile
The time complexity is: O(nlogb)

Space complexity: O(1)
