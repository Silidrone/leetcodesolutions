Intuition  
We are given two sorted arrays, and the first one has enough space at the end to hold both. To avoid overwriting useful data in nums1, we merge from the back.

Approach  
Start from the end of both arrays and compare elements. Place the larger one at the end of nums1 (from index m+n-1 down to 0). Once either array is exhausted, copy any remaining elements from nums2 (since remaining nums1 elements are already in place).

Complexity  
Time complexity: $$O(m + n)$$  
Space complexity: $$O(1)$$
