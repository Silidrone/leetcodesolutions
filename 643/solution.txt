Intuition  
We need to find the maximum average of any contiguous subarray of size k. Since recalculating the sum from scratch each time is inefficient, we use a sliding window to update the average incrementally.

Approach  
First, compute the average of the first k elements. Then, slide the window forward by subtracting the element that falls out and adding the new one, adjusting the average accordingly. Keep track of the maximum average seen.

Complexity  
Time complexity: $$O(n)$$  
Space complexity: $$O(1)$$
