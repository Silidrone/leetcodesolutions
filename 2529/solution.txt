Intuition
The most important thing here to realize is, if you encounter a number (say the middle one in the array) based on it being positive or negative, you can make claims:

i: index marking the beginning of the array
j: index marking the end of the array
mid: (i + j) / 2

if it is a positive number, you can increment the positive count by (j - mid) + 1. Then, solve the problem for j = mid - 1.
if it is a negative number, you can increment the negative count by (mid - i) + 1. Then, solve the problem for i = mid + 1.

Complexity
Time complexity: O(logn)
Space complexity: O(1)
