Intuition  
To swap every two adjacent nodes in a linked list, we can iterate through the list in pairs and adjust pointers accordingly. Using a dummy node helps simplify pointer updates at the head.

Approach  
Use a dummy node pointing to the head to handle edge cases. Iterate through the list with two pointers, `prev` and `curr`, and swap each adjacent pair by adjusting `next` pointers. After each swap, move `prev` and `curr` forward by two nodes.

Complexity  
Time complexity: $$O(n)$$  
Space complexity: $$O(1)$$
